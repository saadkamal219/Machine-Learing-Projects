**Student Performance Prediction Model with Machine Learning**
This project emphasizes implementing popular **machine learning** concepts over a student performance dataset.

**Dataset Type: CSV**
**About Dataset**
This dataset approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 strongly correlates with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued in the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd grades. Predicting G3 without G2 and G1 is more difficult, but such prediction is much more useful.
